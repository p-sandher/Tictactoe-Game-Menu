## About The Project

A game hub with tictactoe and numerical tictactoe with a GUI and terminal version. This is an academic project and the code may not be published publically.

### Built With
* [![Js][Js]][Js-url]
* [![Junit][Junit]][Junit-url]

### Description

This project has the following classes that are extended:
1. BoardGame --> Methods involving the running the game
2. Grid --> Methods with maintaining the gameboard grid 

Interface:
The Saveable class is an interface that is used for loading and saving game files.

Class for file handling
1. FileHandler does the saving and loading of the files

Classes used for the GUI:
1. GameUI --> has the main menu and features that cause the in execution of tictactoe and numerical tictactoe
2. TictactoeView --> GUI of tictactoe, handles all user communication, using TictactoeGame for running the game
3. NumericalTictactoeView --> GUI of numerical tictactoe, handles all user communication, using NumericalTictactoeGame for running the game

Class for Player handling
1.Player ->handles the saving of player profile, loading a player profile, and creating the string of the player score board 
Player Profile Format 
<Name>,<Games Won>
e.g. a textfile would look like 
Kathy,3
Classes used in tictactoe
1. TictactoeGame--> Methods involving the running the game (player turn, checking is game is over, creating messages to print, error checking user input, handles game play)
2. TictactoeGrid --> Methods with maintaining the gameboard grid (placing game piece, updating grid, checking for wins, handles anything related to the grid)
3. TextUI --> Handles all the printing to the terminal and getting user input

Classes used in Numerical tictactoe
1. NumericalTictactoeGame--> Methods involving the running the game (player turn, checking is game is over, creating messages to print, error checking user input, handles game play)
2. NumericalTictactoeGrid --> Methods with maintaining the gameboard grid (placing game piece, updating grid, checking for wins, handles anything related to the grid)
3. NumericalTextUI --> Handles all the printing to the terminal and getting user input


All classes use exceptions, encapsulation,inheritance,interfaces, constructors, accessors, mutators and other object-oriented concepts.


### Dependencies

Java Libraries Used: 
    Java Swing libraries<br />
    import java.io.File;<br />
    import java.util.Iterator;<br />
    import java.lang.String;<br />
